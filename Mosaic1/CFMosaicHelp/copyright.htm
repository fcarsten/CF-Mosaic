		<P><FONT color="#0000ff" size="4"><STRONG>Some Notes on Copyright</STRONG></FONT></P>
		<P><STRONG>CF Mosaic</STRONG> uses images to create mosaics. In fact, in most cases 
			it will use quite a lot of images. This can lead to a wide variety to copyright 
			issues. What copyright rules apply to you depends on which jurisdiction you 
			live under and the cicurmstances you use <STRONG>CF Mosaic</STRONG> under.&nbsp;It 
			is your responsibility to find out what they are and act according to these 
			rules. Sometimes such rules might not be obvious at first glance. I therefore 
			compiled&nbsp;the following&nbsp;list of important aspectes regarding copyright 
			in images. This list is not complete, nor do all the issues in this list 
			necessarily apply to your situation. This list is therefore only to be used as 
			a very rough guideline:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Images are in most cases protected by copyright. If you don't have the 
			copyright to an image you can't use it in a mosaic.
			<LI>
			This might also apply to the image you convert into a mosaic.
			<LI>
			Whether or not&nbsp;you have the copyright&nbsp;for an image, if the image 
			contains a person that person might have certain rights which could prevent you 
			from being allowed to&nbsp;use the image in a mosaic.
			<LI>
				Whether or not&nbsp;you have the copyright&nbsp;for an image, if the image 
				contains objects for&nbsp;which&nbsp;other parties hold certain rights, this 
				might prevent you from being allowed to use&nbsp;that image&nbsp;in a mosaic. 
				Such objects could be artworks, buildings, etc.</LI></UL>
