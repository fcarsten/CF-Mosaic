		<P>I created and maintain <STRONG>CF Mosaic</STRONG> as a hobby. Most of the stuff 
			I can and I enjoy doing myself. There are a few exceptions:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				<STRONG>CF Mosaic</STRONG> currently does not have an icon. If you have the 
				necessary artistic skills and want to donate an icon, this would be very 
				welcome. Be warned however, I'm very picky.</LI>
			<LI>
				I develop <STRONG>CF Mosaic</STRONG> using&nbsp;C# Visual Studio 2005 Express. 
				I do so because it is free and I don't really feel like spending more than my 
				time on this hobby. If you&nbsp;are&nbsp;in the position to&nbsp;donate a 
				legal, full version of MS Studio 2005 this would be much appreciated.</LI>
